## Why we need webpack: 
Since the broser cannot recognize the import and export, so it is a special environment. 

`npx webpack main.js` will generate a dist for broswer to use. 

then import the `dist/main.js` can run the import file successfully. 

As we using the module bundle, we can use the ES6 gammar in the broswer
